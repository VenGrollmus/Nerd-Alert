                            <h4>Background</h4> 
                            <p>I graduated high school in 2021. I have lived on the Mornington Peninsula my whole life. I am 18 years old and love basketball. I play Big V youth league for southern peninsula sharks. I have 2 siblings; my brother is 14 and my sister is 10. I was born in Frankston and my nationality is Australian. I have completed a Certificate II in business at Chisholm TAFE, completed white card training and have my year 12 certificate. English is my only language I can speak fluently; I have learnt a little bit of Indonesian and German but thatâ€™s just from school so not a whole lot.</p>  
                            <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                            <p>My hobbies consist of basketball and gaming, I love going surfing and playing football as well. If I'm not playing those sports usually you can catch me on the couch watching them.</p>
                            <h4>IT interest</h4>
                            <p>I have always had an interest in technology. From a young age I have always been on technology and loved it and as I got older, I wanted to know more about it and make a career out of it. I think my dad is defiantly the one who sparked my interest in IT, he works in IT and has been for a very long time. My main interest in the IT industry is cyber security.</p>
                            <h4>IT Experience </h4>
                            <p>I have very little IT experience, I have done about 4 months' work experience in web design and graphic design.</p>
                            <h4>Ideal Job</h4>

                            <h4>Background</h4> 
                            <p>Well truth be told I am a bit of a mixed bag. My father is 100% German, therefore that makes me 50% German and the rest can be split up between, Greek, English and Afrikaans, which is my mothersâ€™ side of the family. As I grew up in South Africa, we followed their culture, being meat lovers and loved a good old braai (BBQ). This changed once a year when we visited my German gran for a month while on holiday, which then included Pork Knuckle, Bratwurst (Grilled Sausage), SpÃ¤tzle (Egg Noodles) and Sauerkraut (Fermented Cabbage).</p>  
                            <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                            <p>I currently play roller hockey for the Mighty Ducks, which is exactly like Ice Hockey, but using Inline Skates. I also play field Hockey for OHA on a social level.</p>
                            <h4>IT interest</h4>
                            <p>My IT interest first started back in 1987 when I got my first Atari 1200XL, how exciting the door to the world of computers had just opened to me. I can still remember the book that came with it, silver cover and written on the front in big black letters, the words BASIC. This was the first programming language I was introduced to. Spent hours writing code, only to land up drawing a single triangle. At this stage I thought watch out Bill Gates, thinking I would change the world. Then it seemed to phase out for a while, more interested in dating that computer, until I joined the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, where I was introduced to COBOL. Self-taught, I wrote many data queries but never really did and programming, and through time lost interest. I am back, just like Arnold Schwarzenegger, working towards a Computer Science Degree, hopefully majoring in Data Analytics.</p>
                            <h4>IT Experience </h4>
                            <p>The only real IT experience I have is the exposure I have had through the various companies I have worked for over the year, whereby most of the things I have learnt is through observation and a level of self-discovery. Itâ€™s amazing to see how much you can learn by just watching and listening.</p>

                            <h4>Background</h4> 
                            <p>I am an experienced HR administrator with a passion for people. I am curious, an avid reader and now student. Words that people have used to describe me are quiet, observant, detail-oriented, helpful, and joker.</p>  
                            <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                            <p>Music is my passion; the most incredible experience so far was watching Dimmu Borgir play at the Roundhouse, London in 2018.</p>
                            <p>I also have two black cats, Fluffers and QT McWhiskers named after two characters in Futurama. We have had them for around six years, and they are very demanding.</p>
                            <h4>IT interest</h4>
                            <p>My interest in IT began around 2007 when I bought my first computer and created my first character in the World of Warcraft. It just awakened a natural curiosity inside around computers and technology in general. I did a certificate in Software applications at TAFE. However, I had to put further study on hold as I later was accepted for a business administration traineeship on the same campus. During my traineeship I was given an opportunity to work in the IT helpdesk, logging calls and helping with basic troubleshooting. Later I commenced at the University of Western Australia as a Human Resources Assistant. I benefited from understanding the software used in my line of work. Excel is an essential tool to customise reports and I enjoy helping my team troubleshoot issues such as processing issues in Ascender, Mail merges in Microsoft Word, Pivot, and VLOOKUP in Excel, or providing direction with system updates. We have many platforms that feed off Ascender.</p>
                            <h4>IT Experience </h4>
                            <p>My experience in IT is limited to troubleshooting and computer service. Recently I have played a part in rolling out new systems and training users on systems in the university.</p>

                            <h4>Background</h4> 
                            <p>I was born in Sydney and have what they call a Heinz variety background. My father is German, and on my mum's father side of the family is Chinese and Aboriginal. On mum's mum side of the family, we go back to England. I started working at Woollies back in the day where price guns were still being used and it was my job to do the weekly specials each Saturday, and price the stock. During this time, I also was in the Army Reserves in Victoria as an Engineer (Sapper) with the 7th Field Engineer Regiment. After working for Telecom/Telstra for nearly 25 years and then another business for a couple of years, I now work for myself providing administrative support, help desk services, and develop websites and applications for several clients across Australia and New Zealand. I also volunteer at the local RSL Sub-Branch to provide support to veterans and their families to ensure that they are enjoying life.</p>  
                            <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                            <p>My hobbies are watching Sci-Fi movies and TV series, esp. Star Trek. I do go to the occasional live show, which includes <a href="">David Strassman</a>. I have seen his show twice already and have booked into another show in May 2022.  I also try to conceptualise new applications or variations to existing applications to try to develop new ways to do a task or a set of tasks to make life for small businesses easier.</p>
                            <h4>IT interest</h4>
                            <p>My current interest in Information Technology is around programming, developing apps and websites. The programming languages that I have used are Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications, Objective-C and .Net. I am more comfortable utilising VB and VBA as I have been using this technology for over 30 years. I started programming at school back in 1983, yes that long ago, and was in one of the first classes to study computers in Year 12 (HSC). It has continued since then. There wasnâ€™t a particular event of person that sparked my interest, I seemed to just fall into roles that needed me to know programming or automation of spreadsheets to be able to produce reports effectively for management.</p>
                            <h4>IT Experience </h4>
                            <p>My experience in IT dates back to 1989 when I started work at Telecom, which is now Telstra. I started in Property Services when I started to move from a paper-based system for tracking the maintenance of properties. I then moved into Workforce Planning and automated the management of HR figures by pulling data from dumb terminals and transitioning the figures into a spreadsheet. I finally moved to the billing system team and managed the change control repository for the group and worked with deployment and testing of the billing system. Then I picked up new areas to manage, which included smaller applications that interact with the billing system to manage and merge billing accounts into a single bill.</p>
                            <p>I now work for myself and provide several services to my clients: ranging from managing a helpdesk, developing applications and websites, and selling and servicing of hardware.</p>
