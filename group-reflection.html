                    <p><strong>What Went Well</strong></p>
                    <p>Patrick and Ven have been helpful towards setting deadlines and taking tasks to complete for the project.  The positivity from Patrick and Ven in the meetings to discuss progress, set deadlines and task deadlines have been productive overall.  I think it took a little while for the team to get started on producing the work but once we did it was a good flow.</p>
                    <p>Setting up the group was initially challenging as this being a group assignment, working remotely was something new, challenging yet exciting. We believe that working with Microsoft Teams was beneficial as it allowed us as a group to keep track of the outstanding objectives of the project.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What could be improved</strong></p>
                    <p>Our team meeting attendance could be improved, we’ve tried to work around schedules and events but there were times where we could not do 2 meetings a week as specified in the assignment. Going forward I’m not sure how we could improve this since everyone’s situation is different and life happens.  The communication overall with Patrick and Ven has been great on Teams, however we could improve in some areas specifically for members who have not been able to attend meetings or contribute meaningfully to the decisions made within the team. Ashton has only attended 1 meeting so far and it’s difficult to get updates or responses from him. We’ve tried our best to be helpful and open with communication but no success so far.   I would also like to improve the project planning within the team going forward as we were not particularly focused on completing many tasks in the beginning which delayed our project development in the end.</p>
                    <p>One of the things that we could improve on is the way we structure our projects in the future to make them as consistent and streamlined as possible. The object here would be to work smarter and not harder. The other opportunity which we did implement along the way was to hold members of the team accountable for their responsibilities and contributions towards the successful outcome if the project.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong></p>
                    <p>How important to have a project manager in the team project, I’m used to working with people equally invested in the project and understanding tasks involved and we delegate to each other as required. I tried my best to fulfill this role to get the assignment to progress. The planning and delegation were more time than I had expected. The team embraced my requests and were great in taking on the work.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong></p>
                    <p>One thing I have learned about groups is to assign roles immediately, it was tough to navigate how the group works together and to make progress without having someone assign tasks and deadlines within the group to ensure progress is made. It would also be great to create a timeline upfront as the project manager so the group can see what is coming up and to work on them as they come up.</p>
                    <p>The one thing that we have learn along the way about working is groups is that we all work an understand things differently. This, however, is not necessarily a bad thing but rather an opportunity to use the different strengths within the group to accomplishes the goals we set out to achieve.</p>
