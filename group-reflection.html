                        <h4>Patrick</h4> 


                        <p>I believe as a group we worked well together. We kept in touch with each other throughout the project to ensure that we kept on track with our required deliverables. Ven added teams calendar events for us to meet twice weekly where we discuss how things were going and to make any corrective measures. Sam added a lot of the technical components to the project and provided a lot of the research around the chatbot and what we needed to make that successful. I challenged myself but volunteering to take on some activities like the UI design which I had never done before to deliver on. There were some challenges along the way as Ven fell ill during the project. This required us to adapt to deliver on the project, which wasn’t so much surprising as a good lesson that not all things go according to plan and that if you don’t adapt along the way you can't meet the scheduled deadlines. The one thing that I learnt regarding working in groups is that we all work differently and that we all possess certain skills that if used correctly can have positive outcomes to the project and deliver the best results.</p>

                        <h4>Sam</h4>
                        <p>Patrick helped the team to keep focus on important tasks, Ven has been a great help in the more technical skills with getting the website together and managing GitHub for the team. I think we managed to get on nicely and communicate well within the team. If we had tasks assigned to a person, they would do their best to complete it. We all have a bit of life experience and work history that has enabled us to make the teamwork in the way that is it does. I have been ill and Ven has as well so there have been troubles with time during this assignment, but we got there in the end as best we could. I took some time off in the beginning and felt really overwhelmed with the tasks and work left in the unit and it helped to talk it out in the team to get some perspective and prioritise to get the urgent tasks completed. I believe I still have a lot of work to do with prioritising workload and delegating.</p>  

                        <h4>Ven</h4> 

                        <p>As a group we worked well together, and the synergy between us could be seen in the work that we produced.  We communicated regularly through MS Teams using chat and had scheduled meetings held on a bi-weekly basis. Where we felt we needed to have a further touch base, then we scheduled another meeting to see how we were travelling with our tasks.</p>

                        <p>I did have a couple of instances where I was not well and ended up in hospital for a day due to a heart issue. This put pressure on the rest of the team, which demonstrated how well we worked together as Sam and Patrick picked the work up like troupers.</p>

                        <p>We realised early on that we needed to manage our expectations on what we were going to deliver during the time period allocated for us this part of project, which we modified for the delivery. We then looked at how we could deliver the complete project going forward, past the end of the study period for this assignment and worked out how to deliver in the timeframe going forward.</p>

                        <b>What went well</b>   

                        <p>Patrick, Ven and Sam have been helpful towards setting deadlines and taking tasks to complete for the project.  The positivity from the team in the meetings to discuss progress, set deadlines and task deadlines have been productive overall.  Due to the first project the bugs in terms of getting started were all sorted out beforehand.  

                        As we already had a group setup the dynamics of setting up a group was a thing of the past. As this being a group assignment, working remotely was something new, challenging yet exciting. We believe that working with Microsoft Teams was beneficial as it allowed us as a group to keep track of the outstanding objectives of the project.</p>  

                        <b>What could be improved</b>  	 

                        <p>Although our team meeting attendance has improved there were a couple of other unexpected challenges along the way. We did not expect one of our team members to became unwell and that required us to adapt and change the way we did things. We’ve continued trying to work around schedules and events but there were times where we could not do 2 meetings a week as specified in the assignment. Going forward we are not sure how we could improve this since everyone’s situation is different and life happens.  The communication overall with Patrick and Ven has been great on Teams. I would also like to improve the project planning within the team going forward as we were not particularly focused on completing many tasks in the beginning which delayed our project development in the end.  

                        One of the things that we could improve on is the way we structure our projects in the future to make them as consistent and streamlined as possible. The object here would be to work smarter and not harder. The other opportunity which we did implement along the way was to hold members of the team accountable for their responsibilities and contributions towards the successful outcome if the project.</p>  

                        <b>At least one thing that was surprising</b>   

                        <p>How important to have a project manager in the team project, we are used to working with people equally invested in the project and understanding tasks involved and we delegate to each other as required. I tried my best to fulfill this role to get the assignment to progress. The planning and delegation were more time than I had expected. The team embraced my requests and were great in taking on the work.</p>

                        <b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b>   

                        <p>One thing I have learned about groups is to assign roles immediately, it was tough to navigate how the group works together and to make progress without having someone assign tasks and deadlines within the group to ensure progress is made. It would also be great to create a timeline upfront as the project manager so the group can see what is coming up and to work on them as they come up.   

                        The one thing that we have learn along the way about working is groups is that we all work an understand things differently. This, however, is not necessarily a bad thing but rather an opportunity to use the different strengths within the group to accomplishes the goals we set out to achieve.</p>
