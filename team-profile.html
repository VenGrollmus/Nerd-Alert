You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still. </p>
                    <p> As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>

                    <p>It helps the team members to understand differences in characteristics and patterns of thinking in order to find ways to work with each other. Working towards each other's strengths in the team by assigning tasks or roles they would be good at is also positive way to approach things. Finding solutions and being mindful of negative aspects can also give perspective in the group when you are still getting to know each other.  </p>

                    <p>The Adventurer’s weaknesses are that they are fiercely independent, unpredictable, easily stressed, overly competitive, and fluctuating self-esteem. Anything that interferes with their freedom of expression creates a sense of oppression, that makes work a challenge. </p>

                    <p>The team composition for the Adventurer is where they have as much wiggle room as possible to do things the way that they like; and be spontaneous, charming, and genuinely fun people to be around.

                    <p>In the Big 5 Test, my scores were high in Altruism, Cooperation, Modesty, Sympathy and Self-Efficacy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Altruism</strong></p>
                    <p>Altruistic people find helping other people genuinely rewarding. Consequently, they are generally willing to assist those who are in need. Altruistic people find that doing things for others is a form of self-fulfilment rather than self-sacrifice. </p>

                    <p><strong>Cooperation</strong></p>
                    <p>Individuals who score high on this scale dislike confrontations. They are perfectly willing to compromise or to deny their own needs in order to get along with others.</p>

                    <p><strong>Modesty</strong></p>
                    <p>High scorers on this scale do not like to claim that they are better than other people. In some cases, this attitude may derive from low self-confidence or self-esteem. </p>

                    <p><strong>Sympathy</strong></p>
                    <p>People who score high on this scale are tender-hearted and compassionate. They feel the pain of others vicariously and are easily moved to pity. </p>

                    <p><strong>Self-Efficacy</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
                    <p>The results of the tests give me an insight into my personality and how this impacts the way I work. I have done tests like this before, and the results between have changed somewhat. This I believe is due to the fact, that as people, we change and grow over time. Life experiences can also affect how we feel and answer questions, and the time of day may also impact our answers. I will need to keep in mind that I am part of a group and need to be able to contribute to the group rather than go on tangents doing my own thing. I will also need to ensure that I speak up with ideas and ensure that I do not take comments as criticisms. As part of a team, I need to consider how I interact with people, and how they interact with others. I believe the current team have compatible personalities, and to date we are working effectively together.</p>
