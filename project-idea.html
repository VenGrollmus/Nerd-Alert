			<h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <h4>Topic</h4>
		    
		    	<p>In this project, the team will plan and design the tool we proposed in A2, a piece of software that can be used to empower staff in an organisation by deploying software with conversational interactions, which is essentially a chatterbot. The chatterbot we are designing is based on open-source libraries, which will allow us to customise the User Experience and how the chatterbot operates. </p>
		    	<p>A chatbot in an organisation can be a valuable tool to support staff within HR, Finance, and Staff Resources on services offered, process information, legislation, and policy details offered at the organisation.</p>
			<p>We aim to design the chatbot to allow the user to input questions or queries conversationally. The chatbot will process the input using the nltk module and find an answer to match the request, which we have trained the chatbot with; the chatbot will then respond appropriately.</p>
			<p>On the outside, the transcript will look like a normal conversation with two parties responding to each other.   
			The chatbot's function would act as a training tool by receiving input from an individual, processing the input using NLP (Natural Language Processing), and providing an answer (What makes a great chatbot? Laser focus on customers, 2022). The input would be in the form of questions related to matters we usually get from customers and colleagues, pointing them in the right direction or giving them resources that could help them find the answers. The chatbot will be trained to recognise topics and keywords and choose the most appropriate and relevant response using the NLP Nltk module. This tool would make life easier for individuals in positions such as frontline customer support in large and complex organisations. </p>
			    
			    
                    <h4>Motivation</h4>
			<p>The motivation for this project is to design and construct software that can be used to support employees within an organisation on Human Resources topics. The result will be to fill a gap in most organisations with the rate of resignations and downsizing since the pandemic's beginning. The pressure and toll of employees left within those organisations are struggling. To avoid a high turnover rate focusing on software to assist and train unfamiliar staff or help existing staff is enormously rewarding.  </p>
			<p>The project motivation cornerstone is based on helping people, and I want to drive the plan's focus towards supporting staff to do their jobs in an efficient and timely manner by creating this tool, building up a knowledge base, and then teaching it to provide the most appropriate answers. The points of everyday user experience outlined by Microsoft (Conversational User Experience Guide, 2021) will allow us to create a solid plan on how we want the chatbot to respond, give it a personality, and map out typical conversations from the user perspective. That will give us an excellent base to set up the appropriate environment and data sets to train the chatbot.  </p>
			<p>Existing trends with chatbots seem to be driven by customer service by including chatbots in frontline services to improve the organisations' image. You may have had many experiences with speaking to a chatbot already, and an example could be a bank app regarding your account or finding a product on a website that you would like to buy. There does not appear to be much of this technology used in the workplace to support internal staff. AWS and Microsoft have included no-code options within their platforms to allow businesses to deploy their chatbots; however, these options are extremely limited with what they can do, and this project aims to explore open-source libraries and customise as required.   </p>
			
			
                    <h4>Landscape</h4>
			<p>Microsoft and AWS provide no code alternatives on their platforms to allow organisations to create a “chatbot” tool that carries out various tasks; however, the reviews indicate a delay in response times and are extremely limited.  </p>
			
                   <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
			<h3>Aims</h3>
			<h4>Project Planning</h4>
			<p>The important parts of the project are mostly in the planning, to get the finer details clarified it is easier to create the appropriate environment to support our initial goals.  </p>
			<h4>Conversation UX/UI and Use Case Model</h4>
			<p>In the planning stages we will need to clarify the use cases, plan the conversation User experience, and this will determine how we go forward in research and code. The chatbot User Interface and website design is another crucial factor, as it will need to be easy to use and quick.  

 </p>
			<h4>Requirements classification</h4>
			<p>Assess and consider all parts of this project:  </p>
			<ul>
                        <li>Functional requirements </li>
                        <li>Non-Functional requirements </li>
                        <li>Use case model </li>
                    </ul>
			<h4>Knowledge Base </h4>
			<p>In the coding stages we would have to write the knowledge base into the chatbot code this would incorporate the details defined in the planning stages.  </p>
			<h4>Expand on the existing chatbot code </h4>
			<p>Once the Conversation UX is completed we can start to expand on the response matches in the chatbot code. </p>
			<h4>Adopt algorithm and Logic Adaptor </h4>
			<p>Once the knowledge base is input, we would have to add a logic adaptor into the chatbot software and adopt algorithms to allow the chatbot to search google for information or we could create a decision tree which is helpful when there are a lot of variables to consider in an answer.  </p>
			<h4>Database design outline </h4>
			<p>The database design fundamentals should be determined back at stage 1, as we chose not to proceed with this section, if there is opportunity for a future state, please define the requirements of the database to proceed with an outline of the design.  

This stage would need to consider draft an entity relationship diagram which includes the User roles, roles, chatbot user, feedback, information (question, answer), log and any other elements defined at stage 1. </p>
			<h4>Algorithms </h4>
			<p>At this stage we will only be working with Keyword matching.  

If we had more time to design and implement the software, we would consider possibly using several algorithms to allow for effective conversation processing and responses. Possible algorithms considered are String similarity, Combination of algorithms, Spell checker, Natural language parser, Google search.  </p>
			<h4>Business logic implementation </h4>
			<p>Business logic would include rules determined by the Business regarding data creation, data storage and changes to those files. At this stage we would have to leave this to be determined in the future state. </p>
			<h4>Web Interface (UML) </h4>
			<p>The UML is basic but as we have chosen not to proceed with SQL database the UML is not required until those other details are defined.  </p>
			<h4>SQL Database  </h4>
			<p>A database layer will be implemented in the future using SQL. To plan the database, we would also need to consider hibernate mapping, XML mapping, mapping configurations, DAO, Business Logic Layers.  As this will be in the future state it would also require us to examine how the UI looks with View information, View feedback, View logs from the database layer. In the future stages we would have to implement the ‘leave feedback’ option within the conversation as a fall back towards the end of the conversation to allow us to review and gauge performance quality. In addition, I do not believe that adding personal information is needed at this stage of the project, if the chatbot were to implement ML/DL algorithms then it would be necessary to personalize the conversation with those details. </p>
			<h4>Testing </h4>
			<p>Setting up a test that goes through simulated conversations to check expected responses, reviewing and amending the software as part of the testing process will be invaluable.  </p>
			<h4>Priorities </h4>
			<p>These parts should priority over the others to progress with the project successfully.</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Clarifying the use cases </li>
				<li>Conversation UX </li>
				<li>Developing the Chabot software code </li>
			</ul>

			<p>If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, the conversation UX/UI details is the compulsory for the software code.  </p>
			<h4>The artifacts we intend to produce from this project:  </h4>
			<ul>
			<li>The conversation UX outline  </li>
			<li>Requirements classification </li>
			<li>Use Case Model </li>
			<li>Logos and website design/UI </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Plans and Progress  </h3>
			<p>Our plan is to follow this methodology to provide an accurate vision of our plan and implementation.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Define requirements </li>
				<li>Analysis and Specification </li>
				<li>Design </li>
				<li>Coding </li>
				<li>Testing </li>
				<li>Acceptance</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Define requirements  </h4>
			<p>The overview of the project proposal was discussed within the team, and we agreed to progress our A2 project in line with the A3 specification. To effectively design the project based on our project specification we tried to clearly state our interpretation of the project specification against our project plan of action. </p>
			<p>The necessary tasks are defined and clarified within the Aims of the project plan. We will not deviate unless it is deemed necessary as the project progresses to avoid the ‘scope creep,’ that would more than likely result in not having a finished product. The product will be a basic rule based chatbot with several responses it can answer with. We will have a website design mock up as that will act as the UI but due to the time limitations, we will not have the chatbot deployed on the website. The focus during this project will be on the background design to implement.  </p>

			<h4>Achievements </h4>
			<p>We have several achievements during this project. </p>
			<ol>
				<li>We managed to touch on a lot of the design points in the project.  </li>
				<li>We have a basic chatbot with a limited number of responses.</li>
				<li>We now have a mock up design of what the User Interface will look like.  </li>
				<li>The requirements have been classified.  </li>
				<li>We also have the Use case model and user story. </li>
				
			</ol>
			<p>All these artifacts are key to the next stage of implementation and coding.  </p>
			
			<h4>Limitations </h4>
			<p>Our limitations mostly come down to time and skills. We lack skills in some areas that required us to research and understand some areas of the project. We originally planned to include the chatbot demo as an artifact however, there were some issues getting the web framework to host the chatbot. Also, the additional algorithm in the code needed time and data to integrate into the code otherwise we would have a chatbot continuously going off topic which is not appropriate for this project.  </p>
			<h4>Future work </h4>
			<p>There is so much Future work that needs to be done to improve or and advance the software which has been noted throughout the project. The most important is to integrate an SQL database and that will allow for more functionality in the chatbot software. The code requires a logic adaptor, and another algorithm to supports a decision tree model.  </p>
			<h4>Conclusions </h4>
			<p>In conclusion we touched on a lot of elements in the planning stage that we hope is a good foundation to expand and implement the chatbot code. We’ve had a few issues, due to team members falling ill and that has resulted in some lost time and changed our original intentions for these past few weeks.  </p>
			<h3>Roles  </h3>
			<p>Due to the limited resources available for us to complete the project, as we had four members of the team at the start of the course which then became three the allocation of work had to be shared, therefore on occasion there needed to be cross pollination of roles. We as a team did this quite successfully which reflected the marks, we achieved in assignment 2. </p>
			
			<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
