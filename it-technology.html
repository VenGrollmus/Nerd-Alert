                    <h3>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                    <strong>By Patrick</strong>
                    <h4>What does it do?</h4>
                    <p>The idea of blockchain technology is to record information and to make it almost impossible to change, hack or manipulate. A blockchain is a list of records linked together using cryptography (Greek meaning – Kryptos “hidden, secret” and graphein “to write”) which contains information from the previous block or message. There are three components of each message. The first component is the <strong>cryptographic hash</strong> containing details of the previous block, which is an algorithm that maps arbitrary size data to a fixed size called the “hash value”. The hash value then references a has table which references keys to values, these are one-way functions that are practically impossible to invert or reverse. The second component is a <strong>timestamp</strong>, which keeps track of the creation and modification time of the document. This is a layer of security where no one can change the message not even the owner once the message has been created. The third component is the <strong>transaction data</strong> which is generally represented as a Merkle tree. A Merkle tree encodes the blockchain in an efficient and secure manner.</p>
                    <p>A blockchain is therefore a digital ledger of transactions consisting of blocks that are used to record transactions across multiple computers to ensure that these transactions are secure and cannot be altered, without altering all the subsequent blocks. Blockchain databases are managed on a peer-to-peer networks. These networks are computers that are equally permissioned and have the same level of responsibility to process data. Blockchain technology can be described in the forms of an inverted pyramid, the more layers are added the more secure the encrypted messages become as each layer added includes details of the previous layer.</p>
                    <p>In the next 3 years or less there is talk about a blockchain revolution, which sounds rather dramatic, however eight out of the world ten largest companies are building an array of products that incorporate blockchain technology. Companies recording and overseeing transactions stand to benefit from using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology has already been adopted by a number if industries like, finance, retail, real-estate, logistics and health care but to name a few.</p>
                    <p>Although the birth of blockchain technology was mainly surrounding cryptocurrencies it has now moved to other industries due to its secure cost-effective nature and opportunities presented. It is on the verge of replacing many other technologies as the preferred option. The bigger the blockchain the longer the time taken to create the next block within the chain and the more secure the block and the more complicated it would be hack the chain.</p>
                    <p>The move to blockchain technology is on the rise as only 1% of CIOs in 2018 adopted the technology and this has increase to 5% in 2019, believe this is the game changer for the future.</p>
                    <h4> What is the likely impact?</h4>
                    <p>Blockchain technology has the ability to revolutionise the way we do business and replace the current technologies we have and use. There are a range of benefits on offer and something to consider which include the enhancement of security, greater transparency, reduction of costs, increased efficiencies, speed of transactions and improved traceability. The technology is currently strongly affecting the financial services industry especially the accounting, auditing and banking sector allowing cross-border transactions in a shot amount of time without having to incur currency exchange fees.</p>
                    <p>Blockchain technology has the potential to change a number of different industries. At this this stage it is currently used in the financial sector to trade digital currencies like Bitcoin, however it also has to potential to be used in things like, the clearing, settlement and reporting of trades in the financial markets. Nearly 40 institutions have formed a Post Trade Ledger Working Group to determine to feasibility of using this technology to facilitate these processes. This technology has also been considered in mortgage industry and cross boarder trading. There are a number of other industries that are exploring the feasibility of block chain technology, like, Shipping and Supply Chain, Proxy Voting and Elections, Healthcare and even the government but to name a few.</p>
                    <p>With blockchain technology there will be a level of increased automation, therefore a decrease in the number of jobs that required manual verification of documents and processes. As this relates to more efficient processes, there will be a reduction in these types of jobs and services to machines, however there will be a requirement for new skills to be learnt to fill the gaps created by these changes. It is important to recognise that technological changes of the past have made many jobs unnecessary but have in turn created even more jobs in different sectors, just creating different opportunities rather that economic uncertainty.</p>
                    <h4> How will this affect you?</h4>
                    <p>The world is ever changing and so is technology and the need to keep up is key to managing your day-to-day living. I think blockchain technology is here to stay and it is critical to understand how this will impact you and your loved ones. At this stage I believe there is a small component of people who truly understand how these technologies work and how they impact our daily lives. With the changes implemented by blockchain technology, I believe that the way we get paid will soon be in digital currency not only based on its flexibility but also because of its convenience and security. Currently there is a level of decentralisation and the non-commitment on the side of the central banks to adopt the currency based on compliance and regulations concerns, however I believe that this will change in the future.</p>
                    <p>As the idea behind blockchain technology is a secure medium of transacting peer-to-peer, this not only relates to money but also assets. It is my view that the older generation like my parents will be left behind as they will not understand the new technology and the processes. In terms and me this will require a better understanding of what is possible and how. In terms of my children this will just be the way of the world and will become part of their normal day to day living.</p>
                    <p>In some ways this will become the new norm in others it is concerning, as the world forgets the simplicity of life and the real reasons for living. My biggest concerns for myself and my family are that the more we change the easier things become and the less resilient we become.</p>
                    <p>Blockchain is here to stay, like it or not. The say the more things change the more they stay the same, or do they?</p>

                    <strong>By Sam</strong>
                    <h4>What does it do?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)</strong></p>
                    <p>The history of AI is a progression that started with neural networks, evolved to machine learning and now we have reached a phase of deep learning. Chatbot software integrated with Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing concepts that when setup correctly can evolve and learn to do numerous functions. (Machine Learning: What it is and why it matters, 2022).</p>
                    <p>John McCarthy defined Artificial Intelligence as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.” (McCarthy, 2022)</p>

                      <strong>Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding</strong><br>
                      This development in Natural Language processing can be used to allow the chatbot to recognize user intent efficiently, decode the mood of users instantly, and drive the flow of conversations in tune with customer’s emotions.  The study of NLP is broad as there are many algorithms to support different operations to process language such as extraction, tokenize, stop words, and response matching. Extraction selects the important keys words of the input received and summarises the query further according to those key words to understand the query. Tokenize will separate each word or sentence as “tokens” to allow easy matching (5 Simple Ways to Tokenize Text in Python, 2022). Stop words are considered low level information, in this process they are identified and removed from the input as they are normally interchangeable and not relevant, words such as “the”, “a”, “so”, “what” (Text pre-processing: Stop words removal using different libraries, 2022). Stemming will remove a portion of the word down to its root meaning (Stemming? Lemmatization? What? 2022). Response matching in a rule-based system, you can have a set of Reponses and the response matching process will process the input and match the appropriate response. It is also possible to leverage the chatbot sentiment analysis feature to easily know if customers are having a pleasant experience with your chatbots (End to End Question-Answering System Using NLP and SQuAD Dataset, 2022).

                    <p><strong>Modern Chatbot developments</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Chatbots can be defined as ‘conversational agents (CA) that enable users to access data and services (Følstad et al. 2019) as well as exchange information by simulating a human conversation (Bittner et al. 2019; Diederich et al. 2019)’ (Antje et al. 2019, p.212). The are many types of chatbots such as Informational Bots, Application Bots and Productivity Bots. The use case of an organisation will typically establish their requirements of the chatbot and then develop based on those needs. There are many use cases for chatbots in general however the most popular is Customer Service, Help-Desk Support, Call Center, Marketing, Sales, Workflow.</p>
                    <p>The pillars of Customer User Experience with Chatbot Software seem to be driving the demand and popularity of this technology such as efficiency, accessibility, intuitiveness, empathy and trust (Conversational user experience - Bot Framework Composer, 2022).</p>
                    <p>Popular chatbots that have integrated with other services for general purpose:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Siri virtual assistant created by Apple integrated with Apple services and runs on NABC framework. NABC, Needs, Approach, Benefits, Competition (Curt Carlson: There is a Systematic, Repeatable Process to Generate Customer Value | Hunter Hastings, 2022).</li>
                            <li>Cortana created by Microsoft using the SDK framework and is a digital assistant integrated with Microsoft services Link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana</a></li>
                            <li>Google Assistant work with the SDK framework and is integrated with many of Googles current services and devices, designed to act as a digital assistant.  Link: <a href="https://assistant.google.com/" target="_blank">https://assistant.google.com/</a></li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Conversational applications</strong></p>
                    <p>UI Conversational software application is a collection individual delivery style such as (Are Chatbots Dead? What Digital Innovation Leaders Should Know in 2020, 2020): 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Text-based interfaces (like chatbots) </li>
                            <li>A graphic user interface (GUI)</li>
                            <li>Voice-based interfaces (like Amazon's Alexa) </li>
                            <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
                            <li>A rule-based approach </li>
                            <li>Decision-tree methodology</li>
                            <li>Human assistance</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong></p>
                    <p>Sentiment analysis is a subdivision of machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) that can help chatbots learn sentiments or emotions from written or speech data (Agarwal, Nayak, Mittal and Patnaik, 2020).</p>
                    <p>Sentiment analysis is used to train chatbots with more human alike capabilities by learning to identify emotions within unstructured texts, IoT such as Siri or Alexa benefit from this to understand emotion in context to provide more value to the user (Agarwal, Nayak, Mittal and Patnaik, 2020).</p>
                    <p>Developing chatbots with the sentiment analysis we can ensure that when a user engages in a conversation, the bot will be able to assess if it was going well and respond to customer emotions accordingly (Agarwal, Nayak, Mittal and Patnaik, 2020). Chatbot sentiment analysis can be used in many and various ways to raise customer satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>Further development in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to train the chatbots to speak and understand the context of the conversation could become powerful in such a way that AI chatbots would be difficult to identify by the user and perhaps become inbuilt into androids or robots in general. Chatbots could have their own personalities and eventually think for themselves without the need for humans to train them to evolve. In addition to the advances the rise of citizen developers has become so popular that platforms have actively developed and packed software that allows application building that contains AI training without the need for the knowledge of code for ordinary people, Microsoft and AWS allow access to no code dev ops for enterprise.</p>

                    <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
                    <p>The development of AI in Chatbots may bring chatbots and AI into the normal of frontline customer service and replace humans in this space. Its already started with basic chatbot automation in the marketing space or bots in general with multiple functions. It allows the business to focus their time and efforts on more value-add work and focus on other developments.</p>
                    <p>This could result in loss of jobs for those that are in those areas of work. Higher standards of customer expectations and perhaps further personalisation and understanding of customer needs and desires to entice them for whatever reason. Achille Ettore has stated his prediction that AI will evolve to making decisions instead of humans in the 2020 trends video published by SAS (Artificial Intelligence (AI) Trends for the 2020s, 2020). The video (Humans Need Not Apply, 2020) illustrates significant figures that show robot automation is already affecting the workforce in a variety of jobs. The increase demand for robots will result in a decline to costs of these services as they become more popular. The fact that the robots have a higher accuracy rate or more functions than humans is a major factor, humans are social and can get distracted or sick that can affect their work performance and robots do not. Certain professions would eventually evolve into looking completely different to what they are now. Take accounting for example before computers, the accountant’s entire job would manually writing financial records and re-writing the records when a change was records. Now that job can be done in second by excel on a computer. The accountant’s life is more focused on future projections and providing advice which is interesting to think about. The life of an IT professional could become drastically different with automation in ways we cannot foresee now.</p>
                     
                    <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
                    <p>If we were to have a conversational personal assistant in the way Microsoft has created power virtual agents on our phone with enough data it could learn and teach itself with an efficient ML environment, it could learn to be much more useful. NLP built with an appropriate algorithm that in a way that allowed the device to understand you and predict your actions, by running through similar versions of ourselves to predict our actions and desires, we could become dependent on having  a personal assistant. I think that there would be positives and negatives to this. Would we become so dependent on technology that we forget to do certain things ourselves? What benefit would we have other than saving time, I’m not sure, it's difficult to imagine a scenario that may or may not happen.</p>
                    <p>Vantage Market Research (Healthcare Chatbots Market Global Size, Share, Forecast 2022 - 2028 | Vantage Market Research, 2022) published some data in 2021 that suggests the market demand for Healthcare Chatbots with increase exponentially from 2022 – 2028 which could be a possibility noting we see more automation happening in this field to relieve the health care system. Health care automation, we could have an AI doctor like IBMs Watson, if this reduces the wait time to see a health professional, it could change people's lives. This would absolutely be an advantage and allow the existing GPs to choose to spend more time on value-add work, however they see fit.  (A Beginner’s Guide to Using Chatbots in Concierge Medicine | AI in Health, 2022). Woe Bot is a Chatbot that was created to help people monitor their mood and learn more about themselves. The framework is integrated with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and encourages people to talk about issues and provides videos and tools as appropriate (FAQ, 2022). A study published on 12 April 2022 (He et al., 2022) highlights that chatbot AI can help motivate people in their goals, in this case it was to quit smoking, and the act of chatting to the bot could build up over time.</p>

                    <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
                    <strong>By Ven</strong>
                    <h4>What does it do?</h4>
                    <p><strong>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</strong></p>
                    <p>Cloud Computing and Services is the newish paradigm, even though it has been around for approximately 15 years now, for the hosting of delivering of services over the internet.  Some of the services that are available is data storage, application hosting such as Microsoft Office, and video/movie sharing services such as Plex, Netflix, and Prime Video.</p>
                    <p><strong>What can be done now?</strong></p>
                    <p>Cloud computing is attractive to business owners as it eliminates the requirement for users to plan ahead for provisioning and allows enterprises to start from the small and increase resources only when there is a rise in service demand.</p>
                    <p>Cloud Computing has evolved from infrastructure, a place to store data, to platforms that run applications to now being able to develop cloud-native services.  The major suppliers in the cloud services realm are Amazon, Microsoft and Google.  They have always understood the importance of data for businesses and wanted to make it affordable for businesses to migrate and store their data and have made it affordable.  The players also understood that systems and processing would follow.</p>
                    <p>This is something businesses and individuals need to keep in mind when planning their core cloud destination for the data.  Even if the advanced services aren’t used initially, this could be a long-term relationship which will need to included in your decision making when looking at the core data location.</p>
                    <p>Other services that are available is the ability to teleconference, by using applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams.  With this software we have the ability for video conferencing, being able to record the meetings and sharing screens to manage projects and discuss issues with software that may not be performing or operating as expected.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</strong></p>
                    <p>Over the next three (3) years, I see ‘cloud-native’ applications/services being developed, when incorporated together, will deliver solutions for businesses with flexibility and scalability for them to be able to push the boundaries of innovation in the field they compete in.</p>
                    <p>I believe that a crucial part of this will be virtualisation of operating systems rather than the traditional virtual machines that mimicked entire computers or servers.  It makes the overall system more efficient at application hosting, and the flexibility and easier to move them to wherever you want them to be; if that is moving from one provider to another, or from one data centre to another.</p>
                    <p>What is important to understand is how to deploy new ideas and innovations to the cloud, and leveraging the power of the platform, and being able to do it quickly and safely without the possibility of opening security issues from poorly written code that will allow nefarious users to access details or to place malware/viruses onto your cloud environment which would cause issues to the business either at the data or financial level.</p>
                    <p><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible?</strong></p>
                    <p>The technological and developmental improvements that have made these services possible is the improvement in internet access, esp. with the advent of the NBN, 5G, and Wi-Fi 6; as this relates to the speed of accessing data.  IT Hardware has also seen an improvement in the manufacturing of the equipment, processing speed of the hardware and storage availability either being SATA drives or Solid-State Drives.

                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the likely impacts? </h3>
                    <p><strong>What is the potential impact of this development?</strong></p>
                    <p>The potential impact of this development is that businesses may no longer need servers on site, or centralised with their IT department, which will reduce the financial outlay for the hardware.  The only drawback to with having the services in the cloud and relying on the data; esp. mission critical data / financials, is if the user’s connection to the internet it interrupted due to an unplanned outage could cause major issues with them in delivering their services to their client<br> base.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is likely to change?</strong></p>
                    <p>Going forward, with the way technology has changed; from the size of mobile phones and the data that they can store, mobility devices such as laptops and iPad’s; we may see the technology become smaller and easier to use.  The technology may even be surgically implanted and linked to the user via their DNA, with HUD’s (heads up displays) for the user to interact with the devices.</p>
                    <p><strong>Which people will be most affected and how?</strong></p>
                    <p>With the different services available, I believe everyone will be affected.  The reason for this, is that people are utilising the various video streaming services and data storage services.  Businesses are utilising cloud services such as hosted Office365 Exchange for emails, as well as OneDrive / SharePoint for filesharing, and with website hosting being so affordable now, that more businesses are utilising websites for keeping in contact with their client base and selling products and services online as well as in store.</p>
                    <p><strong>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</strong></p>
                    <p>I believe some jobs within the businesses that utilise the cloud services will be made redundant as they will not need as many IT support staff to support onsite hardware.  The offset to this will be that new jobs will be created for those specialising in setting up and monitoring cloud services, and those developing cloud centric applications and services.  I don’t think technologies will be made redundant, just improved upon to be able to keep up with the cloud services on offer<br> to the general population and the needs that the population are looking for.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
                    <p><strong>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</strong></p>
                    <p>In my daily life, being connected to the cloud with my phone, iPad, laptop and desktop all the time means that I am always contactable by friends, family, colleagues, customers and suppliers which means that I have very little down time.  The only real way to ensure that I maintain some sort of work life balance, and switch off is to turn the devices off, leave them on my work desk and go to another room.</p>
                    <p><strong>What will be different for you?</strong></p>
                    <p>With the improvement in cloud services, I am looking at utilising the services for my own business to increase my productivity and connectivity.  I would also like to be able to utilise the technology to provide add-on services for my clients and help them improve their productivity and scalability to ensure the services and products that they produce, and supply are of exceptional quality and delivered on time.</p>
                    <p><strong>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?<br></strong></p>
                    <p>My family and friends are currently utilising streaming services to watch their favourite shows and movies, and utilising hosted exchange for emails.  Going forward, the advances in technology may be hard for my parents will be that they are unsure how to use the technology and find it hard to manage or keep track of what they are using or what to use for different applications or services.</p>
